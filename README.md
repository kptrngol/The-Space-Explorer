#the lone space

In search of valuable deposits, Joseph is forced to engage in a solitary dance amidst a ring of ice and rocks. His endless solitude is interrupted by a mysterious noise coming from the unilluminated side of the orbit.

The lone space is a simple Raylib based game. The project was started with an aim to learn the basics of the Raylib library and game programming.


This exercise was focused on: 

- first ECS-like system implementation

To do:
- instalation package for linux
- menu module and play again - function that initializes default game settings
- fix multiple respawn bug
- multiple life points
- fix borders sticking issue/figure out something better
- Adding large rocks to create the scale effect
- adding front layer of background that makes steering harder as we cannot see some obstacles, additionally it creates an effect of stalking Joseph's ship

optionally: 

- use the side of starship as a texture
- when travelling up textures should react
- present textures from the side perspective

- diagonal movement
- see the ship damage after loosing life point
- space key directional boost
- better textures 
- texture randomizer (rotation, size)
- story dialog box module
- save game data (score)
- new types of objects (landing on object to extract resources)

spoiler: there is nothing more on the other side, just more endless longing
