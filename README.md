#the lone space

In search of valuable deposits, Joseph is forced to engage in a solitary dance amidst a ring of ice and rocks. His endless solitude is interrupted by a mysterious noise coming from the unilluminated side of the orbit.

The lone space is a simple Raylib based game. The project was started with an aim to learn the basics of the Raylib library and game programming.


This exercise was focused on: 

- my first ECS-like system implementation

Must:
- instalation package for linux

To be done:

- dynamic memory allocation for number of entities variable
- add dialog window on the bottom with avatar placeholder
- fix multiple respawn bug
- fix borders sticking issue/figure out something better
- water like movement 

Optionally: 
- overall textures upgrade
- use the side of starship as a texture
- when travelling up textures should react (sprites)

- diagonal movement
- see the ship damage after loosing life point
- space key directional boost
- better textures 
- texture randomizer (rotation, size)
- story dialog box module
- save game data (score)
- new types of objects (landing on object to extract resources)

Script:



spoiler: there is nothing more on the other side, just more endless longing
